# Digiskills-Course-Automation

This extension is for use "ONLY WHEN" due to some reason you were not able to watch all of the lesson videos and you have to complete the course to get the certificate. 
This extension can only be used on the Digiskills website where you watch the lesson videos.
Using this extension will automatically change to the next lesson video once the completion status is successful that is usually after 30 seconds of watching the video regardless of skipping the video in timeline.

# How To Install:

After you have downloaded the extension, unzip the folder and then go to chrome://extensions or opera://extensions,
Enable Developer Mode and click "Load unpacked",
Choose the folder of the extension and the extension will be added to browser.
